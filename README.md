# Tic-Tac-Toe-Machine

The tic-tac-toe machine is a simple Python bot that plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human. The first version of the bot is created by brute-forcing the possible moves of the game, and listing the possible moves in the program. The second version is based on a random selection of moves, which results in shorter code. The third version is the most optimized, using a relative-coordinate algorithm that has both relatively simple code and a high win-rate.
